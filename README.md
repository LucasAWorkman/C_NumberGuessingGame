# psuedo


## Intro
ask for the users name using scan with a string

print the users name with hi and that they will play the game

## while Loop

use a variable keepgoing to determine that the loop is going by having it set to true

get a variable **guesses** for the total user guesses +1 for each iteration

get a random number 1 through 100 set it as an int variable

make a blank int variable userGuess to store the guesses

use scan and & sign to set the input to that variable

print the turn number and and ask user for int input


## Conditions
if the user guess is higher than the random num, print "Too high"

if the user guess is lower than the random num, print "Too low"

if the user guess is == to the random num, print "you got it", end the loop

when they guess it, add two conditions, one that checks if guesses is less than or equal to 7, then print good job, in seven guesses

if above seven guesses, print they didnt get in seven but its ok
